## ToDo:
* Widen `keep clear` for USB connection on Thru Hole APM and SMD APM
* Make `keep clear` on mounting holes bigger
* Find a solution to breaking USB connections
* Keep enclosures in mind from Rev A
* Get repo ready for new staff
    * This means creating board directories ready to be worked on
    * However this is defined, make it so that they can jump right in after learning Eagle
* Board Specific Fixes (See each README)
* Auto BOM database project

## Repo Structure:

**Boards**: Contains all necessary information about each board, including KiCad (and old Eagle) files, arduino test files, and board specific documentation.

**Docu**: All docu packets and scripts. *Fragile! Do not touch!*

**prod**: Finalized gerbs and other necessary production files (BOM, CPL, etc...) sent out to fabrication

**img**: Place all your images in here to enhance your READMEs.

**src**: Necessary KiCad files to work on PiElectrical

**Makefile**: Runs scripts to make life easy

ToDo is on the README to keep things easier to see at first glance. GitHub issues tracker can be used as well.

## Setup

### Initial Setup of PiElectrical repo on your computer

1. Copy the URL for pioneers/PiElectrical to your clipboard: (Or here: https://github.com/pioneers/PiElectrical.git)
2. In Terminal (Mac, GNU/Linux) or Git Bash (windows), navigate to your working directory (that is, the directory that you want to keep PiElectrical in.)
3. Clone PiElectrical by running this command: `git clone https://github.com/pioneers/PiElectrical.git`

### Installation of KiCad on your computer
1. Download the latest version of KiCad here: https://www.kicad.org/download/
2. Run installer. Use all default settings on installer. <br>

### Setting up KiCad
1. Open KiCad.
2. Depending on whether you've used KiCad before, select the appropriate option on the pop-up. (Default settings if you're new to KiCad). <br>

### Initial Setup of PiElectrical repo on your computer

1. Copy the URL for pioneers/PiElectrical to your clipboard: (Or here: https://github.com/pioneers/PiElectrical.git)
2. In Terminal (Mac, GNU/Linux) or GitBash (windows), navigate to your working directory (that is, the directory that you want to keep PiElectrical in.)
3. Clone PiElectrical by running this command: `git clone https://github.com/pioneers/PiElectrical.git`
4. Do your work in Eagle.

### Setting up Eagle

1. Open up Eagle. The version number shouldn't be an issue, besides generating docu packets. Google is your friend.
2. Go to Options -> Directories
3. For Libraries, Design Rules, CAM Jobs, and Projects, add the PiElectrical directory by clicking on each box and hitting browse, until you find the PiElectrical directory. It should look something like this: ![directories](img/eagle-directories.PNG)
4. Enable the pie.lbr by going back to the Control Panel, expanding Libraries, finding pie.lbr, right clicking on it, and check off `Use`. You can find it at PiElectrical/src/pie.lbr
5. You are ready to use Eagle!

## Work Flow

Protocol when working on Eagle files

The revision number should be *REV 10A* for Revision A Year 10

If you are not quite familiar with git, see [Useful Links](#useful-links) for the PiE Github tutorial

**WARNING**: Do not modify pie.lbr, pie.dru, or pie.cam without discussing it with PMs

### Steps when working on EAGLE files:

1. In Terminal (mac, GNU/Linux) or GitBash (windows), navigate to your working directory (wherever you have PiElectrical).
2. Make sure your working directory is clean: git status
3. If you haven't started your sub project: git checkout -b YOURNAME-SUBPROJECT
  3. YOUR\_NAME/SUBPROJECT is now the name of your branch
4. Do your work in EAGLE.
5. Once you are at a good stopping point in your EAGLE work, commit your progress:
  5. git add path/to/your/file
  5. git commit -m "Make your commit message short and with this format"
  5. **NOTE**: Commiting is like saving your file, but for all of PiE as well as your personal computer. And just like saving, Commit Early & Commit Often!
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you are finished with your EAGLE work.
7. Once you have made your last commit, push your files to the PiElectrical github repo: git push origin YOUR\_BRANCH
    7.. If you get a merge conflict, contact the PMs for help.
8. If **completely** done, submit a Pull Request

### Commit Message Format Conventions

* Present Tense ("Reroute power traces on team flag", not "Rerouted power traces on team flag")
* No period at the end: ("Reroute power traces on team flag", not "Reroute power traces on team flag.")
* Keep your message length to about one sentence.

### Merge Conflicts: What Do??

Don't try to fix it yourself: Eagle files are finicky and you might break all your work!

Ask someone who knows how to deal with this, i.e. your PM or something

## How to Create a Gerber

1. Open the brd file
2. Click Cam Job
3. Open pie.cam
4. Make a directory in each sensor's folder called SENSOR\_NAME-gerb
    * SENSOR\_NAME **must** be the exact name as the brd file
5. Run job, and click yes to all for the polygon issue
6. Once all the jobs are done, run `make gerb`

## Docu Packets

**ONLY WORKS IN EAGLE VERSION 7.6, 7.7**

Make sure that `eagle xvfb pdftk` are all installed.

If you don't have the proper directories loaded into Eagle, the first script will hang forever. Both should take only a moment.

The `Docu/all_docu.sh` script will run the following for all boards:

```shell
python generate_bom.py ../Boards/BOARD_NAME/BOARD_NAME.sch BOARD_NAME.csv

python docu-packet-gen.py ../Boards/BOARD_NAME/BOARD_NAME.sch ../Boards/BOARD_NAME/BOARD_NAME.brd BOARD_NAME.csv BOARD_NAME.pdf
```

## FAQ

Q: What's the difference between commit before I pull?

A: Do you want to keep any of the changes? Then commit those (the ones you want to keep) before you pull. Or else, the things you pull might conflict with your work, and you'll have a git disaster.

Q: I worked on my stuff, pulled, and everything I did went away!

A: As long as you committed, the PMs can recover your work for you.

Q: Why am I working on my own branch?

A: This is to keep track of pull request and board reviews on a per board basis
